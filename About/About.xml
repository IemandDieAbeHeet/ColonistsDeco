	<description>This mod adds the ability for colonists to decorate their own rooms.

Features:
- Colonists will walk up to a random wall in their room, then they will hang up a poster. Doing this levels up their construction skill.
- Colonists will randomly place an item on their bedside table. Doing this levels up their construction skill and it increases the beauty of the room.

Planned:
- Add room specific decorations
- Add customisable decorations
- Add UI button to preview decoration in full size

Camera+ is recommended if you want to see the decorations in detail.

Feel free to contact me if you have any problems with the mod.

Current version - [V1.1.0]
